    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>
      Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user
      interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext
      Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript
      portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side
      programming. It encompasses everything from building a simplepage of HTML
      text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be
      accessed via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.
